## Project Description

The Chernika Dance Studio project is a website for the first Strip Dance school in Poland. This website allows users to explore class offerings, instructors, class schedules, pricing, and contact information for the school. The site also includes sections with videos showcasing classes.

**Please Note**: The live version of this website is hosted but is not the official website of the company. The project is currently being continued by another individual.


## Technologies

The project was built using the following technologies:

- HTML5 and CSS3 for structuring and styling the website.
- JavaScript for interactive elements and functionality.
- Django as the web framework for handling server-side logic.
- FontAwesome for icons.
